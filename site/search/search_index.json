In our case it is better to work off the queries than having a query builder. Goals [x] Generate C# Query classes for Queries and Mutations [x] Generate C# Models for Query return types [ ] Emit multiple files [ ] Full integration testing of the CSharp code against a dokerized GraphQL server [ ] Type converters for LocalDate and some excotic Scala scalar types we have CSharp template GraphQL code generator template for C# projects using instructions provided at this site . This template reads the introspection JSON of a GraphQL schema as an input. The user has to also mention the output folder where the file has to be written The name of the output file can be defined in src/config.ts Usage For executing the template, install graphql-code-generator first. See the install instructions here . Once we install graphql-code-generator, clone this project into your workspace. After cloning the project, we can either install or build the template to function the graphql code generator. Install the template using npm install command from the project folder path. npm install -g After installing the template, run the following command to generate the c# code from the graphql schema. gql-gen --schema \"graphQL schema JSON path\" --template \"graphql-codegen-csharp\" --out \"output folder path\" You can either build the template using yarn build command and run the following command to run the generator. gql-gen --schema \"graphQL schema JSON\" --template \"path of the template file\" --out \"output folder path\" Other Cli Flag options are listed here .
